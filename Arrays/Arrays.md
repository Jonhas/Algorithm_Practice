# Array
Is the array sorted or partially sorted? If it is, some form of binary search 
should be possible. This also usually means that the interview is looking for a
solutiuon faster than O(N). 

Can you sort the array? Sometimes sorting the array first may significantly 
simplify the problem. Make sure that the order of array elements do not need to 
be preserved before attempting a sort. 

For questions where summation or multiplication of a subarray is involved, 
pre-computation using hashing or a prefix/suffix sum/product may be useful.
